# Study group schedule
This is a schedule for the Python Interest Group learning Python using Melanie Walsh's [*Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python*](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html). It has been adapted based on the course schedule provided with the book. 

If you can't get through any/all of the pre-work, please attend the meeting anyway! We will go over the material during the meeting and will spend it as a working session. It's considered pre-work so as to uncover as many questions before the meetings as possible, but completing it is not a requirement to attend.

* Pre-work: Read through [Chapter 1: The Command Line](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/01-Command-Line/01-The-Command-Line.html) and try to install Python, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebooks
