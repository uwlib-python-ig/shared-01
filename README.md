# shared-01
Shared code -- notebooks, scripts for review, code discussed at meetings, ...

## Shared code file-naming conventions

- If code was shared at a UWL-PIG meeting and [meeting notes](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/meetings) exist, use the meeting notes filename for a shared Python or `.ipynb` file, or folder in the case of multiple files.
- Otherwise, use a brief descriptive phrase (lowercase, no punctuation, underscores in place of internal whitespace)
### Example
| meeting notes | shared code |
|---|---|
| 20210617_intro_jupyter_notebooks.md | 20210617_intro_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb |
| n/a | mini_python_intro.ipynb |
